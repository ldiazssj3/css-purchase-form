# css-purchase-form

It is requested to build an html with the following characteristics:

An ordered list with the following items
  - Product Selection
  - Payment method
  - Payment Form
  - Purchase Success

An unordered list with the following items:
  - blue product
  - red product
  - orange product
  - green product
  
  CSS:

- The #wrapper should have 12px of padding, a border radius of 12px, and a 
background color of #e0e0e0.

- The ordered list should be styled as a stepper component:
   - This stepper should be horizontally centered with no padding, but it
     should maintain its default vertical margin.
   -  Each list item in the stepper should have its corresponding item
      number above its text content, and this number should be inside of a
      circle with a white  background color, a width of 30px, 8px of bottom margin,
      a font-size of 24px, and a solid, black, 4px border.
      The number inside of the circle should be horizontally
      and vertically centered, and the circle should be horizontally
      centered above the text content.
   - The number-circle for the list item with the selected class should have 
     white text and a background color of #279600
   - Between each pair of adjacent number-circles should be a 4px-tall balck 
     horizontal line. These divider lines should be vertically centered with
     respect to the number-circles, and they should sit exactly between the
     circles, just touching their edges.
     
- The unordered list should be styled as follows:
  - The unordered list should maintain its default margin, but it should
    have no padding.
  -  Each list item in the unordered list represents a single product
     offering and should have 12px of padding, 12px of vertical margin, a
     height of 40px, a border-radius of 8px, bold font, and a white background color.
  -  The labels should have 4px of left margin and a text color based on
     the list-item class, following this mapping:
     - .blue-product: #626ee3
     - .red-product: #890023
     - .orange-product: #f37f11b
     - .green-product: #11967e
  - Each product-offering list item should also have a solid, 5px left
    border of the same color as its text.

- The "Continue" button should be aligned to the right side of the #wrapper
, with 12px of padding, a font size of 16px, a border radius of 8px, a background color of
#02203c and white text color.

For convenience, the starting code includes variables with most of the
specified pixel values and colors.
